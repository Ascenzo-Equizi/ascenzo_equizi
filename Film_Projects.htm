				<p>
					In my first year of university, I got the opportunity to plan and create a title sequence. <br>
					When it came to choosing a company I decided to make Ascenzo FX because my name is Ascenzo and I am a VFX artist. <br>
					I really enjoyed making this title sequence and I hope you enjoy it as well.

				<p>
					In my first year of university, I got the opportunity to plan, develop, and create an advertisement for a product of my choosing. <br> 
					One part of this task was to create the product of my choosing, so I decided to make a bourbon whiskey drink called Phoenix Fire Bourbon. <br>
					There is no particular reason for this, I just thought the name sounded "cool". Once my product was approved I then had to create an advertisement to sell the product.<br>
					I had a lot of fun creating this advertisement and I hope you enjoy it.

				<p>
					One of my favorite TV shows is Jeff Davis's Teen Wolf TV show starring Tyler Posey and Dylan O'Brien. <br>
					When the opportunity came to create a movie/TV show introduction I knew I wanted to try and recreate the Teen Wolf intro. <br>
					Here is the version I created for one of my university classes, I hope you enjoy watching it.

				<p>
					In my first year of university, I got the opportunity to recreate a scene from a movie or TV show. <br>
					I decided to try and recreate the "No Hope Scene" from the Teen Wolf TV show starring Tyler Posey and Dylan O'Brien. <br>
					The reason I wanted to recreate this scene is because it is such a powerful scene in itself and if you have seen the show this is a pivotal moment. <br>
					I would also like to apologize in advance for my terrible acting and other than that I hope you like this scene recreation.
