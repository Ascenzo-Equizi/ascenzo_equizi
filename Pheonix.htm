  				<h1>Phoenix (Voice Operated Virtual Assistant)</h1>
  				
  				<p>I decided to test my all of my skills in developing a product to make peoples lives easier at home, work or at school.
					My product is a voice operated virtual assistant some examples of this include Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.
					Working functions include Asking for the Date and Time, Asking for the current Weather (Adelaide), A working calculator,
					The ability to play music, The ability to say jokes, riddles, and quotes, To search the internet for answers to random questions and much more.
					The basics of the product is if you speak or type a command the raspberry pi does do something.
					if the command you say, or type doesn’t exist then the program will ask
					“Sorry I don’t Understand, Would You Like Me to Run a Search for that”. The program does say and display the text version of whatever the program needs to say.
					Overall I enjoyed making this project and it was a fun challenge, I am proud to now say I have a voice operated virtual assistant.
					I decided to name this voice operated virtual assistant “Phoenix” after the mythological creature.</p>
